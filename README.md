# DangerousInTheDarkGame
This game is very simple, it teaches me to program.
The game is designed as an educational project in the programming language "Pascal".
Your task in this game - to reach the last level, but the road there is not easy. 
You will fight monsters in every level. Each monster has its own order of attacks.
Every five levels a boss appears. 
After defeating the enemy, you are given the choice to take a new weapon, but not all weapons are good.
